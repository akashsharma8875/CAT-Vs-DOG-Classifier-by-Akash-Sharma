Problem statement
An image processing company is trying to build a model for classifying the pets (dogs and cats). As the artificial intelligence evolving day by day we asked for build a deep learning model for classifying the given image whether cat or dog.

An Image Dataset of 25000 images in which 20000 are trained and 5000 for test.

The classification is done upon 3 process which is Basic CNN model, Transfer learning, and using encoder for output feature selection.
Each process was done sepertely with the help of Google Colab and Conda.
